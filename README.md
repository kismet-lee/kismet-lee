- 👋 Hi, I’m @kismet-lee
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development, design, music, and art!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tailwindcss, storybook.js, js, react, php, and python whilst working some interesting jobs. Take a look at my portfolio here on Github. I am easing my way into adding react components to some of my projects. If you have any feedback or want to contribute, I would love it if you did. Help a junior out!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects that involve language learning and art. I also want to create my own app one day!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
